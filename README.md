CTWdata
=======

The University of Leiden presents a course [Configuring the world](https://www.coursera.org/course/configuringworld " link to configuringworld") on the Cousera platform.
Central in this course are six spreadsheets with data describing the state of 153 countries.

In this repo the data scattered over these six spreadsheets are merged into one .csv file named ctw.csv
This ctw.csv file can be imported easily into statistical packages like R, SAS or SPSS.

Files in this repo
* readme.md      (this file)
* ctw.csv        (the merged data)
* code_book.rtf  (a simple code book with definitions of the column names)
