CTWdata
=======

The University of Leiden teaches a course [Configuring the world](https://www.coursera.org/course/configuringworld "link to configuringworld") on the Cousera platform.
Central in this course are six spreadsheets with data describing the state of 153 countries.

In this repo the data scattered over these six spreadsheets are merged into one .csv file.
This ctw.csv file can be imported into statistical packages like R, SAS or SPSS.

Files in this repo
* readme.md      (this file)
* ctw.csv        (the merged data)
* code_book.rtf  (a simple code book with definitions of the column names)

**Note** Some columns in ctw.csv have missing data, these missing data are coded as NA.
